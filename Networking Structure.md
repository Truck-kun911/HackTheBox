# Proxies
## Forward/Dedicated Proxy:
- server that sits in front of a group of client machines
- when the client makes a request to a site or service, the server intercepts it and communicates with the web server<br>![Screenshot 2024-11-06 232927](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8c16ec23-f811-475b-b3f3-58b1d7994a39)
## Reverse Proxy:
- server that sits in front of a web servers
- forward client requests to those servers<br>![Screenshot 2024-11-06 233451](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e7e2a331-c552-4abb-b265-77e802d9c4b7)
## Transparent Proxy:
- the client doesn't know about its existence
- intercepts the client's communication requests to the Internet and acts as a substitute instance
## Non-Transparent Proxy:
- we must be informed about its existence
- we and the software we want to use are given a special proxy configuration that ensures that traffic to the Internet is first addressed to the proxy
- communication can't be done via proxy if the configuration doesn't exist
